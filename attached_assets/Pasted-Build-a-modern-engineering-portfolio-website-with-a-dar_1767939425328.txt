Build a modern engineering portfolio website with a dark, technical aesthetic inspired by mechanical schematics, blueprints, and system diagrams. The site should feel precise, engineered, and professional — not flashy — with subtle motion and strong hierarchy suitable for recruiters.

Tech Stack & Constraints
Framework: Astro


Use React islands only where interactivity is needed


Language: TypeScript


Styling: Tailwind CSS


Animations: Framer Motion (subtle, minimal, purposeful)


Static-first architecture (fast load, SEO-friendly)


Deployed as a static site


Clean, readable code structure with reusable components



Global Navigation Bar
Top navigation must include:
About


Projects


Skills


Experience


Goals


Contact / Media


Resume button (opens or downloads a PDF)


Navigation behavior:
About, Skills, Experience, Goals, Contact → smooth-scroll anchors on the homepage (/)


Projects → routes to /projects


Navbar should remain visible (sticky or semi-sticky)



Homepage (/) Layout
The homepage is a chronological vertical scroll.
1. Hero / Landing Section
Large visual hero (blueprint / wireframe / technical background)


Name and title (Mechanical / Mechatronics / Robotics Engineering)


Short, high-impact tagline


Primary call-to-action buttons:


View Projects


Resume



2. About Section
Brief professional overview


Engineering focus, hands-on mindset, systems thinking


Concise and scannable



3. Featured Projects Section
Exactly 3 featured project index cards


Cards must match this structure:


Project image (like the screenshot provided)


Project title


Short project description


Optional “Featured” badge


Tags (one or more):


Mechanical


Electrical


Controls


Software


“View project →” link


Clicking a card navigates to that project’s individual project page


Above or below the cards, include a large CTA button:


“View Full Projects”


Routes to /projects



4. Skills Section
Categorized skills:


Mechanical


Electrical / Controls


Software


Tools / Manufacturing / Simulation


Clean grid or grouped layout



5. Experience Section
Timeline-style layout


Education, internships, work, research, or projects


Focus on engineering responsibility and outcomes



6. Goals Section
This section should exist


Explain engineering direction, interests, and long-term focus


Short, intentional, and forward-looking



7. Contact / Media Section
Email


GitHub


LinkedIn


Other relevant platforms


Clear call to connect or reach out



Projects Index Page (/projects)
This page is the single source of truth for all projects.
Layout:
Grid of project index cards


Cards use the same style as featured cards on the homepage


Project card requirements:
Image


Title


Short summary


Tags (Mechanical / Electrical / Controls / Software)


Clicking navigates to that project’s individual page


Filtering:
Tag-based filter UI


Multiple tags per project allowed


No filters selected by default (all projects visible)


Filtering must be client-side and fast



Individual Project Pages
Each project has its own page


Use a report-style layout, but keep it simple for now:


Title


Overview


Images / diagrams


Short sections (Problem, Solution, Result)


This is a starter template — designed to be expanded later



Design & UX Notes
Dark theme with cool-toned accents (blues, cyans)


Blueprint / schematic visual language


Clean typography, strong spacing


Subtle hover and scroll animations


Recruiter-first readability



Non-Negotiables
Do NOT use heavy frameworks unnecessarily


Do NOT over-animate


Do NOT hide content behind gimmicks


The site must feel like an engineering artifact, not a marketing page
