Replit Agent Prompt — Automated Multi-Zone Garden Irrigation Project Page
This page replaces the existing placeholder individual project page for the Automated Multi-Zone
Garden Irrigation System.
You are building a project page for an engineering portfolio using the attached PDF as the authoritative
layout, structure, and content specification.
IMPORTANT RULES (READ CAREFULLY):
• The provided PDF defines the exact section order, hierarchy, layout intent, and content grouping.
• Do not reorder, merge, omit, or rename sections unless explicitly instructed.
• Treat the PDF as a format and structure reference, not as a final visual artifact.
• All text shown in blue in the PDF is instructional ONLY and must NOT appear in the final rendered
page.
• Blue text exists to guide layout, sizing, and placement decisions.
• Increase all text to normal, web-readable sizes in the final build. Small text in the PDF is only due to
slide layout constraints.
MEDIA HANDLING RULES:
• Do NOT generate any images, diagrams, or graphics.
• Do NOT redraw diagrams or recreate visuals.
• Use only the provided uploaded images and videos.
• Insert images and videos exactly where indicated in the PDF.
• Reference and place media strictly by the filenames shown in the PDF.
• Do NOT bake text into images or convert images into backgrounds unless explicitly instructed.
• Videos should be embedded with their original audio preserved. Do not mute, replace, or remove
audio tracks.
HERO SECTION:
• Use the file named “garden-v2-final-pic” as a full-width hero background image.
• The hero image should be visually softened/faded and treated as a backdrop, not a foreground image.
• All hero text overlays should remain readable and clearly separated from the background.
SUBSYSTEM SECTIONS:
• Treat each subsystem as a mini engineering report.
• Each subsystem must include:
– Purpose
– Final Implementation
– Validation and Calibration (if applicable)
– Iterations and Design Evolution (if applicable)
– Trade-offs and Design Decisions
ELECTRICAL & SENSING SUBSYSTEM:
• Explicitly document that the stepper motor is an open-loop actuator.
• Explain the need for absolute position calibration.
• Include the optical interrupter sensor used for homing and re-zeroing.
• Reference the rotating calibration arm visible in the exploded CAD images.
• Explain how this enables repeatable zone alignment after power loss.
GENERAL EXPECTATIONS:
• Preserve the engineering tone and technical clarity.
• Avoid marketing language or unnecessary embellishment.
• Favor structured explanations over long paragraphs.
• The final result should closely mirror the structure, flow, and intent of the PDF while being optimized
for a web portfolio.
This task is a direct translation of the provided PDF into an editable, structured project page. Do not
reinterpret or redesign the system
